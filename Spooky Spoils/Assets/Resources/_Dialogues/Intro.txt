You heard tell that an ancient treasure is hidden 
within the Blackbourne House down by the stream 
outside of the city.
|
The treasure is an ancient heirloom that was passed 
down the Blackbourne family for generations, but 
the family faded into obscurity long ago. 
|
The idea of finding treasure tantalizes your 
adventurous spirit, and you travel alone outside of 
the city to the Blackbourne House.
|
You are the not first to try scavenging the 
Blackbourne House.
No one has returned from the house by the stream.
