GHOST: 
Avast, ye interloper! Ye tryin' t' steal me treasure? 
I won't be allowin' that, ye scallywag, that treasure 
belongs t' One-Eyed Whitley!
| 
ONE-EYED WHITLEY:
Fer intrudin' on our enterprise, we'll have t' end ye. 
Too bad ye won't be seein' me an' me hearties with 
yer little torch 'less yer one o' us One-Eyed pirates!
|
ONE-EYED WHITLEY:
We'll make 'im walk the plank even if he tries to 
parley, maties!
